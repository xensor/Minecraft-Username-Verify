## Description ##

We're still working on this script, so understand that it is still in beta. We decided to create a plugin that allows staff to verify minecraft accounts. All you have to do is enter a username for the minecraft and it will return uuid, avatar and first name of the Minecraft member. 

## Installation ##

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `miner` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Minecraft and fill in the details.

* Created the class to allow staff members to verify Minecraft Accounts.


## Upgrade Notice ##

# 1.0 #
Beta, Should not be used on a live site. This plugin has been created. We will post updates when we update the plugin. There shouldn't be no issues as the script just pings minecraft api and gets stats on whether or not the username for the Minecraft member is valid or not.
